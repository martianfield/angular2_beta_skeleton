Angular 2 Beta Skeleton App

## Cloning

Navigate to folder where you want the project to be cloned into (note: a subfolder will be created). Then clone this repository

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/martianfield/angular2_beta_skeleton.git
```

While this limits the history of the repository to the latest version, you most likely do not want to remove all traces of git linkage to this repository; simply delete the `.git` folder.

Rename the folder `git clone` created for you to your liking.

## Setup

Navigate into the folder, and install all dependencies using

```shell
npm install
```

## Browser Watching

To watch the application in the server use 

```shell
npm start
```

This will start live-server which will automatically transpile TypeScript and reload your app whenever you make changes.
